## Getting Started

### Dependencies and Installation

This sample code depends on the requests library, which can be found at: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

If you have pip installed, you can add the client and requests to your environment with:

```
pip install ultra_rest_client
```

Once installed, you can use the `ultra_rest_client` module in your Python scripts:

```python
from ultra_rest_client import RestApiClient
client = RestApiClient(args)
```

## Usage

### Authentication

#### Authenticating using Username and Password

```python
from ultra_rest_client import RestApiClient
import os

# Fetch credentials from environment variables
username = os.getenv('USERNAME')
password = os.getenv('PASSWORD')

# Check if credentials are available
if not username or not password:
    raise ValueError("Username and password must be set in environment variables.")

client = RestApiClient(username, password)

domain = "udns-python-rest-client-test.com."

# Get Zone Metadata
print(f"Get metadata for zone {domain}: {client.get_zone_metadata(domain)}")
```

#### Authenticating using Bearer Token and Refresh Token

```python
from ultra_rest_client import RestApiClient
import os

# Fetch tokens from environment variables
access_token = os.getenv('ACCESS_TOKEN')
refresh_token = os.getenv('REFRESH_TOKEN')

# Check if tokens are available
if not access_token or not refresh_token:
    raise ValueError("Access token and refresh token must be set in environment variables.")

client = RestApiClient(access_token, refresh_token, use_token=True)

domain = "udns-python-rest-client-test.com."

# Get Zone Metadata
print(f"Get metadata for zone {domain}: {client.get_zone_metadata(domain)}")
``` 

#### Authenticating using Bearer Token

```python
from ultra_rest_client import RestApiClient
import os

# Fetch token from environment variables
access_token = os.getenv('ACCESS_TOKEN')

# Check if token are available
if not access_token:
    raise ValueError("Access token must be set in environment variables.")

client = RestApiClient(access_token, use_token=True)

domain = "udns-python-rest-client-test.com."

# Get Zone Metadata
print(f"Get metadata for zone {domain}: {client.get_zone_metadata(domain)}")
```

### Quick Examples
This example shows a complete working python file which will create a primary zone in UltraDNS. This example highlights how to get services using client and make requests.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from ultra_rest_client import RestApiClient
import os

def create_zone(client, domain):
    """Create a zone in UltraDNS. This function will create a zone with the name specified in the domain argument.
    It uses the accounts API to get the account name. This is required to create a zone.

    Args:
    - client (RestApiClient): An instance of the RestApiClient class.
    - domain (str): The domain name to be created.

    Returns:
    - dict: The response body.
    """
    account_details = client.get_account_details()
    account_name = account_details['accounts'][0]['accountName']
    return client.create_primary_zone(account_name, domain)

def create_a_record(client, domain):
    """Create an A record in UltraDNS. This function will create an A record with the name specified in the domain

    Args:
    - client (RestApiClient): An instance of the RestApiClient class.
    - domain (str): The domain name.
    """
    return client.create_rrset(domain, "A", domain, 300, "192.0.2.1")


def create_cname_record(client, domain):
    """Create a CNAME record in UltraDNS. This function will create a CNAME record with the name specified in the domain

    Args:
    - client (RestApiClient): An instance of the RestApiClient class.
    - domain (str): The domain name.

    Returns:
    - dict: The response body.
    """
    return client.create_rrset(domain, "CNAME", f"www.{domain}", 300, [domain])

def delete_zone(client, domain):
    """Delete the zone from UltraDNS.

    Args:
    - client (RestApiClient): An instance of the RestApiClient class.
    - domain (str): The domain name.
    """
    client.delete_zone(domain)
    return "Zone deleted Successfully"

def main():
    """The main function. This is the entry point for the script. It parses the command line arguments and calls the
    create_zone, create_a_record, and create_cname_record functions."""

    # Fetch credentials from environment variables
    username = os.getenv('USERNAME')
    password = os.getenv('PASSWORD')
    domain = "ultra-rest-client-test.com."

    # Check if credentials are available
    if not username or not password:
        raise ValueError("Username and password must be set in environment variables.")

    # Create an instance of your client
    client = RestApiClient(username, password)

    # Create the domain
    print(f"Creating zone {domain}: {create_zone(client, domain)}")

    # Create an A record for the domain
    print(f"Creating an A record pointing to 192.0.2.1: {create_a_record(client, domain)}")

    # Create a CNAME record for the domain
    print(f"Creating a 'www' CNAME pointing to {domain}: {create_cname_record(client, domain)}")

    # Delete the domain
    print(f"Deleting zone {domain}: {delete_zone(client, domain)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To set the environment variables, use the following commands in your terminal:

```python
export USERNAME='your_username'
export PASSWORD='your_password'
```

## Functionality

The sample code does not attempt to implement a client for all available UltraDNS REST API functionality.  It provides access to basic functionality. Adding additional functionality should be relatively straightforward, and any contributions from the UltraDNS community would be greatly appreciated. See [sample.py](sample.py) for an example of how to use this library in your own code.
